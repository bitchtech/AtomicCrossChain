# BitBridgeX Security Practices

## Overview
Security is a top priority at BitBridgeX. Our platform uses advanced cryptographic techniques and best practices to ensure that your assets and data are protected.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)
- HTLCs ensure that swaps are either completed or refunded based on a cryptographic preimage, protecting both parties in the transaction.

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)
- Used to validate transactions without revealing sensitive information, ensuring privacy and security.

### 3. Multi-Signature Support
- Multi-signature wallets require multiple approvals before a transaction is executed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### 4. PWR Chain Integration
- PWR Chain enhances scalability and reduces the risk of congestion-related security issues by efficiently handling a high volume of transactions.

## Best Practices for Users

### 1. Protect Your Private Keys
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Use hardware wallets for added security.

### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Use 2FA on your wallet and BitBridgeX account to add an extra layer of security.

### 3. Regularly Review Transaction History
- Regularly check your transaction history for any unauthorized activities.

### 4. Use Multi-Sig Wallets for Large Transactions
- For high-value transactions or collaborative projects, use multi-sig wallets to ensure that multiple parties must approve transactions.

## Incident Response
- In the unlikely event of a security breach, our incident response team is trained to act swiftly to secure the platform and mitigate any risks.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to info@bitchtech.io. We take all reports seriously and will address them promptly.

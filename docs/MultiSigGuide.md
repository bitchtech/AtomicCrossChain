# BitBridgeX Multi-Signature Guide

## Overview
Multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets in BitBridgeX require multiple parties to approve a transaction before it can be executed. This adds an extra layer of security, especially for high-value transactions or collaborative projects.

## Setting Up a Multi-Sig Wallet

### 1. Creating the Wallet
- **Step 1**: Navigate to the Multi-Signature section of the platform.
- **Step 2**: Click on "Create New Multi-Sig Wallet".
- **Step 3**: Enter the addresses of the participants who will be part of the multi-sig wallet.
- **Step 4**: Specify the minimum number of approvals (signatures) required to authorize a transaction.
- **Step 5**: Click "Create" to deploy the multi-sig wallet on the blockchain.

### 2. Adding Funds
- **Step 1**: Once the multi-sig wallet is created, go to the wallet's dashboard.
- **Step 2**: Click on "Deposit" and specify the amount and type of assets to add.
- **Step 3**: Confirm the transaction in your connected wallet.

## Using the Multi-Sig Wallet

### 1. Initiating a Transaction
- **Step 1**: Go to the Multi-Sig Wallet section.
- **Step 2**: Click on "New Transaction".
- **Step 3**: Enter the details of the transaction, such as the recipient, amount, and any additional data.
- **Step 4**: Submit the transaction for approval.

### 2. Approving a Transaction
- **Step 1**: Participants of the multi-sig wallet will receive a notification.
- **Step 2**: Each participant must log in and navigate to the "Pending Transactions" tab.
- **Step 3**: Review the transaction details and click "Approve" or "Reject".
- **Step 4**: Once the required number of approvals is reached, the transaction is automatically executed.

### 3. Monitoring Transactions
- **Step 1**: Go to the "Transaction History" tab to monitor all past and pending transactions.
- **Step 2**: Use filters to search for specific transactions or statuses.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure that all participants are trusted, as they will have control over the assets in the multi-sig wallet.
- Regularly update the required number of approvals based on the evolving needs of the group.

## Troubleshooting
- If a transaction is stuck waiting for approval, contact the participants to ensure they complete the necessary steps.
- For technical issues, contact BitBridgeX support, info@bitchtech.io.

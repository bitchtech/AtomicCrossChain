# BitBridgeX Architecture

## Overview
BitBridgeX is designed with a modular architecture to facilitate cross-chain interoperability, scalability, and security. The key components include:

1. **AtomicSwap Contract**: Core smart contract for handling trustless atomic swaps.
2. **Layer 2 Adapter Contracts**: Extensions to support swaps on Layer 2 networks like BASE.
3. **Multi-Signature Support**: Contracts ensuring secure, multi-party transaction approvals.
4. **PWR Chain Integration**: Provides scalability and reduced transaction latency.

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Separate components for different functionalities ensure flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Integration with Layer 2 and PWR Chain allows the system to handle high transaction volumes.
- **Security**: Use of cryptographic proofs (zk-SNARKs, HTLCs) ensures security and privacy.

## System Components
### 1. AtomicSwap Contract
- Handles the core logic for initiating, completing, and refunding atomic swaps.

### 2. Layer 2 Adapter Contracts
- Specialized contracts for BASE and other Layer 2 networks to reduce fees and increase speed.

### 3. Multi-Signature Support
- Implements multi-signature operations for higher security in high-value transactions.

### 4. PWR Chain Integration
- Provides the backend scalability needed to support a large number of transactions.

For detailed implementation, refer to the respective `.sol` files in the `contracts/` directory.
